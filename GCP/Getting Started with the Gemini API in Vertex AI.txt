    Part,
    SafetySetting,
)

Task 3. Use the Gemini 1.5 Pro model
The Gemini 1.5 Pro (gemini-1.5-pro) model is designed to handle natural language tasks, multi-turn text and code chat, and code generation. In this task, run through the notebook cells to see how to use the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to generate text from text prompts.

Generate text from text prompts
Send a text prompt to the model using the generate_content method. The generate_content method can handle a wide variety of use cases, including multi-turn chat and multimodal input, depending on what the underlying model supports.

Run through the Generate text from text prompts section of the notebook.

Use the Gemini 1.5 Pro model
The Gemini 1.5 Pro (gemini-1.5-pro) model is a foundation model that performs well at a variety of multimodal tasks such as visual understanding, classification, summarization, and creating content from image, audio and video. It's adept at processing visual and text inputs such as photographs, documents, infographics, and screenshots.

Load the Gemini 1.5 Pro model

model = GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-pro")

Generate text from text prompts
Send a text prompt to the model using the generate_content method. The generate_content method can handle a wide variety of use cases, including multi-turn chat and multimodal input, depending on what the underlying model supports.

response = model.generate_content("Why is the sky blue?")

print(response.text)

--response begins---
The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's how it works:

1. **Sunlight Enters the Atmosphere:** Sunlight, which appears white to us, is actually a mixture of all colors of the rainbow. When this light enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny particles like nitrogen and oxygen molecules.

2. **Shorter Wavelengths Scatter More:**  Different colors of light have different wavelengths. Blue and violet light have shorter wavelengths compared to red and orange light. 

3. **Rayleigh Scattering Occurs:** As sunlight interacts with these tiny particles, it gets scattered in different directions.  Shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered much more strongly than longer wavelengths. 

4. **Blue Light Reaches Our Eyes:** This scattered blue and violet light reaches our eyes from all directions in the sky, making the sky appear blue. 

**Why not violet then?**

While violet light is scattered even more strongly than blue, our eyes are actually less sensitive to violet. This, combined with the fact that sunlight contains more blue light than violet, contributes to the sky appearing primarily blue.

**Sunrise and Sunset Colors:**

During sunrise and sunset, sunlight has to travel through more of the atmosphere to reach our eyes. This causes more of the blue light to be scattered away, leaving the longer wavelengths like orange and red to dominate, resulting in the vibrant colors we see in the sky during those times. 
---response ends----

Streaming
By default, the model returns a response after completing the entire generation process. You can also stream the response as it is being generated, and the model will return chunks of the response as soon as they are generated.

responses = model.generate_content("Why is the sky blue?", stream=True)

for response in responses:
    print(response.text, end="")

Model parameters
Every prompt you send to the model includes parameter values that control how the model generates a response. The model can generate different results for different parameter values. You can experiment with different model parameters to see how the results change.

generation_config = GenerationConfig(
    temperature=0.9,
    top_p=1.0,
    top_k=32,
    candidate_count=1,
    max_output_tokens=8192,
)

response = model.generate_content(
    "Why is the sky blue?",
    generation_config=generation_config,
)

print(response.text)

--response begins---
The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's how it works:

1. **Sunlight Enters the Atmosphere:** When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it's made up of all the colors of the rainbow (a spectrum of colors).

2. **Scattering by Air Molecules:**  The sunlight collides with tiny particles in the air, like nitrogen and oxygen molecules. These particles are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light.

3. **Shorter Wavelengths Scatter More:**  Rayleigh scattering states that shorter wavelengths of light (like blue and violet) are scattered more strongly than longer wavelengths (like red and orange). 

4. **Blue Light Reaches Our Eyes:** As a result of this scattering, the blue light is scattered in all directions, making the sky appear blue from our perspective on the ground. 

**Why not violet?**

While violet light has an even shorter wavelength than blue and is scattered even more, our eyes are less sensitive to violet. This, combined with the fact that sunlight contains slightly less violet light to begin with, contributes to the sky appearing blue rather than violet. 

**Sunset and Sunrise Colors:**

At sunrise and sunset, the sunlight travels a longer path through the atmosphere. This means more of the blue light is scattered away, allowing the longer wavelengths like orange and red to dominate, creating the beautiful colors we see.

Safety filters
The Gemini API provides safety filters that you can adjust across multiple filter categories to restrict or allow certain types of content. You can use these filters to adjust what's appropriate for your use case. 

When you make a request to Gemini, the content is analyzed and assigned a safety rating. You can inspect the safety ratings of the generated content by printing out the model responses, as in this example:

response = model.generate_content("Why is the sky blue?")

print(f"Safety ratings:\n{response.candidates[0].safety_ratings}")

--response begins--

--response ends---

In Gemini 1.5 Flash 002 and Gemini 1.5 Pro 002, the safety settings are OFF by default and the default block thresholds are BLOCK_NONE.

You can use safety_settings to adjust the safety settings for each request you make to the API. This example demonstrates how you set the block threshold to BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH for the dangerous content category:

safety_settings = [
    SafetySetting(
        category=HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT,
        threshold=HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH,
    ),
]

Test chat prompts
The Gemini API supports natural multi-turn conversations and is ideal for text tasks that require back-and-forth interactions. The following examples show how the model responds during a multi-turn conversation.

chat = model.start_chat()

prompt = """My name is Ned. You are my personal assistant. My favorite movies are Lord of the Rings and Hobbit.

Suggest another movie I might like.
"""

response = chat.send_message(prompt)

print(response.text)

--response begins--
Hi Ned, 

Given your love for Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, you might enjoy **Willow** (1988). 

Here's why:

* **Fantasy Adventure:** Like your favorites, it's a classic fantasy adventure with swords, sorcery, mythical creatures, and a quest to save the world.
* **Underdog Story:** It features a relatable protagonist, much like Frodo, who rises to the challenge despite seeming unlikely. 
* **Ron Howard Direction:**  If you enjoy the epic scope of LOTR, you'll appreciate Ron Howard's direction in Willow. 

Let me know what you think! I can always offer more suggestions based on other preferences you might have.

Generate text from text & image(s)
Images with Cloud Storage URIs
If your images are stored in Cloud Storage, you can specify the Cloud Storage URI of the image to include in the prompt. You must also specify the mime_type field. The supported MIME types for images include image/png and image/jpeg.

Note that the URI (not to be confused with URL) for a Cloud Storage object should always start with gs://.

# Load image from Cloud Storage URI
gcs_uri = "gs://cloud-samples-data/generative-ai/image/boats.jpeg"

# Prepare contents

Describe the scene?

-------Response--------
The photo shows two small motorboats floating on a wide river.  In the background, you can see several bridges and the Boston skyline. 

Images with direct links
You can also use direct links to images, as shown below. The helper function load_image_from_url() (that was declared earlier) converts the image to bytes and returns it as an Image object that can be then be sent to the Gemini model with the text prompt.

# Load image from Cloud Storage URI
image_url = (
