Testcode
:
Build a transformer based model that reads data from public url
https://github.com/ajaykuma/Datasets_For_Work/tree/main/txt_sentoken

Data acquisition:
Get 5 files each for negative and positive sentiments
text1_n = file1
..
text1_p = file5
..

10 different files

--build your classifier model to classify the content of files into Pos/neg sentiments.
--check this by using more than 1 model

--get the results : labels/score and probabilities of why a label was chosen (hint:using SoftMax)

explore options in this model to focus on multi head attention mechanism
