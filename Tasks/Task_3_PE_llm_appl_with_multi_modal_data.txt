use PE to work with a LLM and build an application, which
extracts information from video (small tutorial video)
summarization of video at different times..

--describe video in x number of words..
--ask further questions about video and appl should generate responses..

Good to have:
use place holders/variables
let your model benefit from techniques such as SC, COT, TOT etc...

and remember to use model kwargs to control  output..
