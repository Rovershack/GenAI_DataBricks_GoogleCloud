Error:

and
Observation: Invalid or incomplete response

agent (CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION) expects a structured output from the LLM like:

Thought: I should look up information on Wikipedia
Action: wikipedia
Action Input: "Alan Turing"

but our LLM (Flan-T5) just said something random like "wikipedia" without following the structure.
Because Flan-T5 (google/flan-t5-base) is very small (250M params) and not fine-tuned for "react-style" agents or structured reasoning.
It doesn’t naturally know how to properly output:

Thought → Action → Observation → Thought → Final Answer
like bigger LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, etc.) or very large fine-tuned Flan models (like flan-t5-xl or flan-t5-xxl).

Also, we can Use AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION instead of CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION.
Because ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION is more tolerant and expects simpler responses.

Note**
ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION is the agent meant for normal Huggingface models.
CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION expects very chat-optimized models (like chat-tuned LLMs: e.g., ChatGPT, Mistral-Chat, etc.)
flan-t5-base is not tuned for detailed chat parsing.

warning:
UserWarning: `do_sample` is set to `False`. However, `temperature` is set to `0.0` -- this flag is only used in sample-based generation modes.

is telling that setting temperature=0.0 while do_sample=False is a bit pointless.
→ No big deal — it won't crash anything. 

----------------------------------------------
Solution 1:
Use a more powerful model that is better at structured outputs.

Instead of flan-t5-base, use google/flan-t5-xl or google/flan-t5-xxl:
when trying:
question = "Alan Turing was a British mathematician and computer scientist, what is he famous for?"
result = agent(question)
print(result)

shows warnings/errors:

Token indices sequence length is longer than the specified maximum sequence length for this model (541 > 512). Running this sequence through the model will result in indexing errors
Could not parse LLM output: Answer: 

Models like google/flan-t5-xl are not trained to produce agent-style outputs (like Thought -> Action -> Observation format).
Even switching agent types (e.g., ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION) helps a little, but the base model still doesn't know the agent output protocol.
When the model answers "Alan Turing was famous for..." it doesn't say what the agent framework expects

Solution 2:
Use a model fine-tuned for ReAct/agent reasoning
These models have been trained to produce outputs that LangChain can parse.

Good options:

google/flan-t5-xl + "Prompt Engineering" (manually prepend special prompts)

or

Use better tuned models like:

mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct
mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct
togethercomputer/RedPajama-INCITE-Instruct
OpenOrca-Platypus2-13B (superb)

But some are bigger models and may need a GPU.
